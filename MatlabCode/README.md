# MATLAB README

## About the MATLAB version
To run the MATLAB version of the code you need a MATLAB license. 
If you do not have that it is recommended to use the Julia version instead since Julia is opensource.

The code was developed in MATLAB 2020b.

## Installation
Installed the code by clonning the git repository by running
    gitclone https://github.com/juliaatz/ShiftOperatorAlgebra.git
in the directory you want the code to be stored.


## Using the code
Start by opening MATLAb. After that navigate to the directory where you chose to store the code
and then this subdirectory (MatlabCode). Alternatively you add this subdirectory to the MATLAB
path, for example by right clicking on the subdirectory and choosing `Add to Path > Select Folders`.

Once you have navigated to the correct directory (or added the directory to the path) you can start
using the ShiftOperator class. To get started with it you can check out the tutorial `ShiftOperatorTutorial.md`.
You can also run the examples from the paper by opening `examples.m`, and then clicking on the `Run` button.
